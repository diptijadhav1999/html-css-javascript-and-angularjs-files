    <P>Microsoft Corp. and Oyo Hotels & Homes have entered into a multi-year strategic alliance to co-develop “next-generation” travel and hospitality products and technologies.

Oyo will adopt Microsoft Azure as a “key enabler” to drive cloud-based innovations and the solutions will be geared to benefit patrons who operate small and medium hotel and home storefronts. Small and independent hotels and homeowners will have access to Oyo’s latest technology to manage their guests’ experience, increase revenue, and run operations with the “security” and “scalability” of Microsoft Azure.

Microsoft has also made a strategic equity investment in Oyo, the Ritesh Agarwal-led startup said, but did not divulge the size of the stake. The deal was reported by ET on July 30.

"For our guests, this alliance will mean more personalisation, better choices, differentiated experiences and an improved guest experience in the future. Microsoft’s commitment is further strengthened by the equity investment in the company," Sinha said.

Oyo said it will develop 'Smart Room' experiences for travellers on the Oyo platform, such as premium and customized in-room experiences for its guests.

Using Microsoft’s Azure IoT, the experience will include self-check-in supported by a digital register of arrivals and departures and self-Know Your Customer (KYC) along with IoT-managed smart locks and virtual assistance.

“Combining the power of Azure with the tech and product stack developed by Oyo, we are looking forward to accelerating innovation in travel and hospitality,” said Anant Maheshwari, president, Microsoft India. “It is inspiring to see how the Microsoft cloud is empowering digital natives like Oyo to accelerate industry transformation and innovations, 
turning the challenges of a post-pandemic era into opportunities for the future,” he added.</P>
